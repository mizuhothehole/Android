Android device the light status

If it is red, means it is not in good status.
In this situation, we have better do the charging.

However, if it is green light and just lighting again and again, it will not have any bad status.
In this situation, it could be charging.

If it is freezed, to close the device forcely, just click the power button and the up button togather.
This will make the display to be black again, so that we could do the charging.

If it is in good status(means the green light lights again and again, then we could do the flash.

Also if we flash the device succussfully, we could disconnect the cabel and then do the charging.
This will let us have the chance of charge the device to 100 percent.

The green light is good signal, we should be happy to see it. Do not be nervous when you see the light to be red again and
again. We will see light to be green someday in the future!
Because we are not doing any kinds of physical damage to the device!
