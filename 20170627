Something about the investigation about android airplane mode control

When we want to open or close the air plane mode, we need to use these two things:

1.the system database
2.a intent
3.a cotentobserver

So when the airplane mode in on, if we want to make the mode into off, we should do it like this. First use to make the system 
database of system into off, then send a intent to the android system, telling the system we want to make system airplane mode 
into off.

Second if we want to make the airplane mode into off, we firstly need to make the system database status into off, and then send
a intent telling the system that now we want to make the airplane mode into off.

In the newest versions, we ofen need to use these to change the system database.

1.change the system database status.
Settings.Global.putInt(getContentResolverSettings.System.AIRPLANE_MODE_ON,value);
Settings.Global.getInt(getContentResolverSettings.System.AIRPLANE_MODE_ON,value);
Settings.Glonal.putString(getContentResolverSettings.XXX,value);
Settings.Global.getString(getContentResolverSettings.XXX,value);

2.use the change action intent to change the airplane status.
And the intent is Intent.ACTION_AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGED;
