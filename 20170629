The asynctask class to control work thread

We can use the light class asynctask to make a new thread and  do work back ground

1.prossbackground ： the code here will excute in the background thread. We can make 
our code running here and move the object to here when we want to do something in 
the other thread.

2.execute （params... ）
we may execute this method when we want to start doing something in the background.
But if we want to make sure the other code will go on running after this， we must
make sure that we also call the get（）method， so as to make sure the thread to wait
until the work thread finished running.

3.get（）
as a method of ensuring the calling back of the work thread，we should call the put
method to ensure the maib thread will wait until the work thread finished the work.
To make a maximum value limit of the waiting time， we should also call a parameter
atrached timemax value like put（timemax）or something. This will make sure we can
call whin the maximun waiting time.If we passed the biggest time we should catch a 
timeout exception anaway.
