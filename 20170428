Research about AnimationUtil

AnimationUtil is a tool class for process of Animation in android.

currentAnimationTimeMillis（）：

this is for showing the current milliseconds of the current animation.
For example， if the animation started at 1234567890123，and the animation
is having the total play time of 1000ms，the value will be between 1234567890123
and 1234567891123， which means it is a full-recording time. However it is
using systemclock of android. It is not using the timestamp in java runtime.
We can get how long the animation is played by using AnimationUtil.currentAnimationTimeMillis-
aninationStartTime（got by other ways）. The value will be between 0 and the 
duration of the animation. If the animation has not been started the value will
be zero.
