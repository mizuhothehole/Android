SOME QUICK COMMAND IN ANDROID STUDIO

Today I will write some kinds of quick command about android studio.
Learning more about the commands will help me to learn more about the env.

The first command is shift,ctrl,plus/minus this will fold or unfold the blocks about the method or the inner class.Sometimes in 
the development of the android when do not know exactly what the arrow marks are showing and we just unfold the source code and
well it is java source in it. And this time we could just use shift,ctrl,plus/minus.

The second I recommand is CTRL,SHIFT,F12, which will hide all windows in the IDE.If we want to see source code in full screen we 
could use this quick command. And see the source code more clearly.


The third commad is the CTRL,SHIFT,BACKSPACE command. This command will go to the last place we editted last time.Of cuz it is quite
useful.

The best command is CTRL,SHIFT,I. This command will show the source of a override method and will not close the window. Sometimes 
we want to see some kind of overwrited classes in exteded classes and do not want to close the window, we could use this.

Another good command. When we want to move a line upper or lower, we will use CTRL,SHIFT,UP/DOWN.This would make the row upper
and lower without ctrl,x and ctrl,v.

Also we can edit a block by using ALT.Block editing is usable.
