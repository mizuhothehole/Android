Using Logs in Android Development

1.when using + in java, it will make the later object to the String. for example, "show me the string" + null , this will be made 
into "show me the string" and will not make any compile error. Also "show me the string" + 1 will show us "show me the string1".
+ will put out the char as it is in memory. It is a very strong calculating mark.
There is a skill when using Log.d(TAG,"some string" + anything in memory); TAG is always the class name.

2.when we use the logs in android development,it seems that we must make a standard to output log. The first way is always make a 
TAG which is the class name of current class. And using "+" is also a good way to make a log without type transfering.Also in my 
point of view, the String before "+" should be the method name at first and then the content of the thing that we want to output.
At last it should be the memory raw data. If it is a kind of edge log, after "+" it should be the "starting", "ending" or something.
Well, anyway we must make a good concept of making a standard.

3.log.d is always used because d means debug. log.i is meaning information, log.e means error, log.w means warning or something.
