Something about the debug version and the release version in android studio

Now I am using the gradlew assemble command to build all the versiona of the
application. The control of different versions of apk is controllef by the 
build type in gradle define.

There are two different ways having a effect on this build file. The first 
option is to effect it in package infomation of the meta dataã€‚ And the second
option is effect the data ditectly by buildConfigField property.

When we want to know what will effect the source code of the process we will 
just investigate the different buildtype options.

Try to learn something about gradle which is also a kind of groove language.

Now I am working in a AI project in Sony mobile.
