SQLiteOpenHelper onUpgrade()/onDowngrad()

I have met a frequent crash happening during our development.
This exception is thrown on the following conditions:

It is like :

android.database.sqlite.SQLiteException: Can't downgrade database from version 2 to 1
06-05 10:03:35.683: E/AndroidRuntime(9010):     at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper.onDowngrade(SQLiteOpenHelper.java:361)

1.The device that you're running the code on has a database file of version
2.The code is requesting version 1 of the database (with a param to SQLiteOpenHelper constructor)
3.onDowngrade() is not overridden in your code.

So as to avoid this issue we need to add implementation as @override in onDowngrade() method.

The most important thing is when is the onUpgrade and onDowngrade are called in our programs.

It is always happening during trying to make a new instances of databasehelper in Java coding while the old
Db file is having the versions that is much newer.

If we want to handle the exception in the onDbDowngrade methods, we need to first clear data and sharedprefs and then to
Call onCreate manually again?

If we just do the clearly,will system call the oncreate for us?

经过调查，我认为对于onUpgrade和onDowngrade，两者的对应应该是类似的。其实对于onDowngrade这个很简单，就是直接的把之前的DB删除，然后再调用一次onCreate
就行了。至于为什么这样，因为在逻辑上，它和onUpgrade的实装是类似的。只不过onUpgrade的话，我们需要作的事情是1 to 2， 1 to 3， 2 to 3的对应。
对于down的，直接就全删了然后再调用一次onCreate就好了。
