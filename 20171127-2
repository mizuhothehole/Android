SQLiteOpenHelper onUpgrade()/onDowngrad()

I have met a frequent crash happening during our development.
This exception is thrown on the following conditions:

It is like :

android.database.sqlite.SQLiteException: Can't downgrade database from version 2 to 1
06-05 10:03:35.683: E/AndroidRuntime(9010):     at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper.onDowngrade(SQLiteOpenHelper.java:361)

1.The device that you're running the code on has a database file of version
2.The code is requesting version 1 of the database (with a param to SQLiteOpenHelper constructor)
3.onDowngrade() is not overridden in your code.

So as to avoid this issue we need to add implementation as @override in onDowngrade() method.

The most important thing is when is the onUpgrade and onDowngrade are called in our programs.

It is always happening during trying to make a new instances of databasehelper in Java coding while the old
Db file is having the versions that is much newer.

If we want to handle the exception in the onDbDowngrade methods, we need to first clear data and sharedprefs and then to
Call onCreate manually again?

If we just do the clearly,will system call the oncreate for us?
