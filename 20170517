Context objects in Junit4 test

Always use InstrumentationRegistry.getTargetContext（） to get the context of the application.
If we try to register a receiver we must use this because android do not support the cases of broadcastreceiver.
This may be the reason of the failure today.
Because I used the wrong context so there is no reaching the on receive method.
