Android Build class

Now I WANT TO introduce the Build class

It contains the android system information

Use signature to confirm the only ROM
Use imei to confirm the only hardware.
Use the thing like this can also confirm something uniqeï¼š
String m_szDevIDShort = "35" + //we make this look like a valid IMEI 

Build.BOARD.length()%10 + 
Build.BRAND.length()%10 + 
Build.CPU_ABI.length()%10 + 
Build.DEVICE.length()%10 + 
Build.DISPLAY.length()%10 + 
Build.HOST.length()%10 + 
Build.ID.length()%10 + 
Build.MANUFACTURER.length()%10 + 
Build.MODEL.length()%10 + 
Build.PRODUCT.length()%10 + 
Build.TAGS.length()%10 + 
Build.TYPE.length()%10 + 
Build.USER.length()%10 ; //13 digits

And Mac infomations of the machine

Mainly the wlan Mac address and the bluetooth address may be used to do this.

Here there is a point to be focused on.

The Build.DISPLAY is infect a number like 10.10.A.10.10 or something else.
It is just the build info to show to users.

And it can also show us the ARM cpu kinds that it supported.
Also can be devided into 64bit cpu or 32bit cpu.
!It is in the Build class that showing the Android system supporting cpu as the base is a linux.
