android.os.HardwarePropertiesManager, BatteryManager and Environment

--------By Android Developers official

-----------HardwarePropertiesManager--------
HardwarePropertiesManager could get the CpuUsageInfo, the fan info, like round per minute, and device temperatures(300K or something).
And using the CpuUsageInfo, we could get the getTotal() method to show the CPU enabled time since it last booted.
!This is got by using getSystemService(String str) or getSystemService(Context ct, Class cls)

-----------BatteryManager---------------
The BatteryManager could show us the battery infomations, just like the battery temperature, the health status, in charge or not.
!This is got by using getSystemService(String str) or getSystemService(Context ct, Class cls)

------------Environment-------------
!This class can be used directly, just like the Build class in android.os package

And the Environment shows us many infomations of android Env.
We can use:
Environment.FOLDER_MEDIA
Environment.FOLDER_DOWMLOADS
Environment.FOLDER_DCIM
Environment.FOLDER_PICTURES
Environment.FOLDER_SHARED
Environment.FOLDER_ROOT

and many other folders like these to get the important system folders directly.
And as a method, we can also use getXXXXFolder() or something like these to get the inportant folder infomations as we wish.
