Android logging system

There are 4 kinds of log buffers:

    1.main
    2.radio
    3.event
    4.system

How to output these in our programming?

    When using JVM:

    1.main -> android.util.Log
    2.radio -> Rlog API
    3.event -> android.util.EventLog
    4.system -> Slog API

    When using native:

    #include <log.h>
    and then set the log tag.
    stdout or stderr will be ignored.

How to read them?

    Use logcat tools.

Will System.out/System.err be outputted to log buffer?

    Yes.

What about kernal logs?

    They are not in log buffers scope and is independent.

How to output all of them?

    > adb bugreport

How to check and analyse bugreport?
