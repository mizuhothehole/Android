The Storage of Android

1.external storage
 1)always can be used
 2)only the app itself can use the data
 3)when you uninstalled your application, all your data will be deleted in this storage
2.out storage
 1)not always usable
 2)everyone can use it. the files here can be used by other applications
 3)when user uninstalled the application, only the files got by getExternalFilesDir() can be deleted.

add the permissions of external storage:
<user-permission android:name android:name = "android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<user-permission android:name android:name = "android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

getFilesDir(): return a object respresending inner storage files.

getCacheDir(): return a object represending inner cache files.


opreration modes of inner storage.
MODE_PRIVATE:in this mode, the data is private. Cannot be seen by other applications.
MODE_APPEND:in this mode, the data can be appended based on the data already had. If no data before, it will create a new file.
MODE_WORLD_READABLE:means this file can be read by other applications.(not recommended)
MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLEmeans this file can be written by other applications.(not recommended)

PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(context) will return a default sharedpreferences with the operation mode of MODE_PRIVATE.

using external storage:
1.getExternalFilesDir(String type):the private storage of application. Will be cleared with the uninstallization of the application.
2.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(String type):can be read and write by other applications.If you supply a non-null type to this function, the returned file will be a path to a sub-directory of the given type.
3.如果你的api 版本低于8，那么不能使用getExternalStoragePublicDirectory()，而是使用Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(),他不带参数，也就不能自己创建一个目录，只是返回外部存储的根路径。
