Something about jobscheduler and jobservice

1.jobservice is a service， but having the onservicestart and on servicestop for developers
to overwrite.

2.we should use the background process methods（like handler or asynctask） to run in the onservicestart method. So we could 
let the processes run in background.

3.we should use build mode to build a job ，define the jobinfo and then use jobscheduler to add the job into the queue.

4.the link between jobscheduler and the jobservice is done by the uid and the componentname

5.we can define the limits or waiting duration of when could the job start when we try to build the jobinfo.
