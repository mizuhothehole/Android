Android test concepts and be a good tester of Japanese projects

Test is important！

We are using and trying some new works called
Android manual test. It is a little hard 
for a new tester because we do not even know
anything about the program. We also do not have enough 
time to see the source code. So how can I continue 
this work.

The first point of view is that test is for 
testing out the mistakes of the source code.
And the winner is who tests out the mistakes.

The second point of view is that the test method 
determines the success of the test.

Seems that I am testing errors by using class UT
and user cases. Well，whether I can win the difficulty
depends on whether the errors of the code can be tested
out or not.

In fact Prem is just wanting me to do this.Not making
some file or some other things.

This time I tested the migration of databases. V1->V3 and V2->V3.
This is a kind of test using test case. For Android test 
upgraded App DB migration，It goes the onupdate method
while there is a data update. Also there will be going
oncreate in databasehelper while the App is newly installized.
Simple logic for db version.The first install always go the oncreate
no matter what the version is.
