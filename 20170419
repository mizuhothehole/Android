Android test concepts

We are using and trying some new works called
Android manual test. It is a little hard 
for a new tester because we do not even know
anything about the program. We also do not have enough 
time to see the source code. So how can I continue 
this work.

The first point of view is that test is for 
testing out the mistakes of the source code.
And the winner is who tests out the mistakes.

The second point of view is that the test method 
determines the success of the test.
