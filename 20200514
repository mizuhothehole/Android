What can you do
As library developer, if you refactor your library to use Android X, you’ll make a breaking change because users that are still on support library can’t include it anymore.
That’s why it’s a recommended practice to release a major version of your artifact with Android X support and include in README which is last version still compatible with Support Library.

We have to migrate to AndroidX as maybe we can hardly let toyota people to change the library...

Arr(using support lib) App(using androidX) -> This is ok. Google made an efficient tool called Jetifier that automatically migrates existing third-party libraries to use AndroidX by rewriting their binaries.
Arr(using androidX) App(using support lib) -> app delelopper will get in trouble.
