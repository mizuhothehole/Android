How to use UsageManager of Android

1. It could listen to some app usage, like APP_MOVE_TO foreground. Which means some activities of an application came to 
foreground by user click.

2. If user changed UTC time to early time, some logs before the time change maybe not affected. Which means, if you change
time from 12:00 to 11:00, the events between 11:00 and 12:00 maybe still existing in system.

3. If we do want to do some kinds of development using this API, we have better to consider the DB efficiency of the records.
Because user do produce so many logs of events everyday.

4. Never add any kinds of IF if you are not permitted to do this. Any kinds of IF will be considered as desige change. And if
you are just a PG, never do this because it will damage the whole design.

5. Never add any kinds of thread if no one told you to do this. This is also design change and need to be discussed.

6. If we want to develop a App depending on this, and implement a provider of this. We can do something like parser by Scanner
in JAVA. It is like spit in javascript. This allow us to develop some scripts using java. And how we implement this will
bring out some good idea of how to do it depending on C or C plus plus.

switch is really important in the scripting development.
