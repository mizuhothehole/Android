Android permission dynamic operation

android.content.pm

content is not same as context. the relationship is like thisï¼šandroid.content.context.java

PackageManager API

1.addpermission
    in order to use this permission we have to make a defination of permission tree in manifest file. And this will make the addpermission api usable. this tree is called permission space.
    Also we can use another method like change linux files but it is not allowed due to security issues. But in tech it is possible but no one break the android policy. But sometimes the data in SdCard seems to be readable and writable.

2.removepermission
    same as addpermission.It refers to a permission space and the modifying of permissions in android package can be done dynamic.

3.addpermissionsync
    seems no one is using this api.
